# Fast Fourier Transform & Inverse Fast Fourier Transform

- Use both `FFT_IP` and `iFFT_IP` with one proccessor on `KV260` and test whether `iFFT` can generate the correct answer from the data output from `FFT`.

**Include files:**

- For testing the functionality of `FFT_iFFT_IP`
  - Include all files in `~/bitstream` and `~/jupyter_notebook` except `~/jupyter_notebook/test_ip_fft_ifft.ipynb`
- For comparing the IP to python function
  - Include all files in `~/bitstream`, `~/python` and `~/jupyter_notebook` except `~/jupyter_notebook/FFT_iFFT.ipynb`
