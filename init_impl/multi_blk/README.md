# Multiple IP implementation on Falcon

- Which contains `compute_pk`, `FFT`, `iFFT` IP
- Will keep update until finish optimization and adding `NTT` `iNTT` IP

## Include files:
- All files under `~/bitstream`, `~/jupyter_notebook`, `~/python`

## Results:

- Since falcon uses `FFT`, `iFFT` many times, we don't output every execution time of them.
